# ShopApp
Single page iOS app that allows users add items to a shopping list and clear list as needed. This project is a [milestone project](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/32) after completing projects 4-6 of the 100 days of swift course by Paul Hudson of Hacking with Swift. 

Some of the concepts used include, Closures, UITableView, navigationItems, UIAlertController and more. 
A couple of ways the app can be expanded include:
- adding columns to contain other data such as quantity of each item
- adding sections to group items into different categories like product type or stores
